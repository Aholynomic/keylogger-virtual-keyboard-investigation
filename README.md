# CMP320-Mini-Project
 An Investigation into Software Keylogger Effectivess of Virtual Keyboards

## Overview
As part of a mini-project conducted in CMP320, I chose to research the security of virtual keyboards and their protection against two common features of keylogger software: keylogging and screenlogging. Multiple software keyloggers and virtual keyboards were tested, which proved that Neo's Safekeys was most successful in defending against software keyloggers.
